    "However, it's important to note that a high R-squared does not necessarily indicate that the model is a good fit\n",

    "\n",
    "Lasso Regularization:\n",
    "Lasso regularization adds the sum of absolute values of coefficients to the cost function, encouraging some \n",

    "Model A (Ridge Regularization with λ = 0.1):\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge regularization will shrink coefficients towards zero without eliminating any entirely.\n",

    "Model B (Lasso Regularization with λ = 0.5):\n",

    "Choosing between Ridge and Lasso regularization depends on the problem and the goals:\n",

    "Model A (Ridge): If you believe that most features are relevant and should be included to some extent, and \n",
    "multicollinearity is a concern, Ridge regularization might be more appropriate. A small regularization parameter(λ)\n",
    "like 0.1 implies that the impact on coefficients is relatively gentle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model B (Lasso): If you suspect that only a subset of features is truly important and you want to perform feature \n",
